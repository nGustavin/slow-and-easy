# Counting syllables

# Define a function named count that takes a single parameter. The parameter is a string. The string will contain a single word divided into syllables by hyphens, such as these:

# "ho-tel"
# "cat"
# "met-a-phor"
# "ter-min-a-tor"

# Your function should count the number of syllables and return it.

# For example, the call count("ho-tel") should return 2.

def count(string: str):
  counter = 0
  for letter in string:
    if letter == '-':
      counter += 1
    else:
      pass
  return counter + 1

print(count("hel-dasd-as"))
